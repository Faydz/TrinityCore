TrinityCore Source w/ Gunship Battle Event

Copyrights for Gunship Battle is now under Angel Gaming Inc.

SQL files to create the databases can be found in the sql/create and 
sql/base directories.
You need to run sql/create/create_mysql.sql 1st and then
SQL files to create the database can be found in the sql directory. Files
to update your database from an older revision/version can be found in the
sql/updates directory.
sql/base/auth_database.sql and sql/base/characters_database.sql
You need to download world database from http://www.trinitycore.org/f/files/
be sure you get the higher numbered database.
When installing a core the 1st time you need to import also all the files at
sql/updates/world directory.
sql/updates/auth and sql/updates/characters databases only needs to be run
when updating one existing server.
To save time importing multiple files, you can use copy *.sql world_updates.sql
under Windows or cat *.sql > world_updates under Linux.

You need to update your core (recompile and overwrite binaries) when updating
your database, usually you can't use one older core with a newer database or a
newer core with an older database.
When updating your core you also need to import the files at sql/updates/auth
and sql/updates/characters along with the sql/updates/world files.
You can't merge all the sql files on sql/updates into a single file, because
they belong to 3 different databases and they don't use database name.
